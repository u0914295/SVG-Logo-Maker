# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description
My motivation for building this application was to make an application that could generate a logo using "node.js" and Inquirer. I built this project because making a logo in other programs can be time-consuming and it's easier to build a program that can do it within seconds. This application solves the problems of having to learn to use more advanced imaging software such as Photoshop or GIMP to build a logo for a company or project. I learned that "node.js" can be a very powerful tool to create applications that vastly quickens the time it takes to create or achieve the goals of your project.

## Installation
In order to run the SVG Logo Maker, please follow the steps outlined below:

Step 1: Ensure that Node.js is installed
The SVG Logo Maker is a Node.js application. Please ensure Node.js is installed on your computer. If it is not, you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Step 2: Install the necessary modules
This application requires the 'inquirer' Node.js module. Change your directory to the project root folder and run the following command to ensure this package is installed:

```bash
npm install
```
This command installs all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file. Currently, the only dependency is the 'inquirer' module.

Step 3: Run the application
To start the application, run the following command in your terminal while in the root folder of the project:

```bash
node index.js
```

Step 4: Input your preferences
The application will prompt you to input text (one to three characters) to be included in the logo, the text color, the desired shape for the logo (circle, square, or triangle), and the shape's color. Answers should conform to the following formats:
- Text: Up to three characters
- Color: HTML color name (e.g., 'red', 'blue'), hexadecimal color code (e.g., '#FF0000'), or RGB value (e.g., 'rgb(255,0,0)').

## Usage
